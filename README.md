 # WeatherApp
 A client-server application developed using Java. The application allows users to see the weather for their current location and features an authentication system for admins, giving privileges like adding a city or a forecast to a city, data that is stored into a JDBC database and retrieved upon request. The application supports multiple clients at once for a better user experience.

 # Luxembourg traffic simulation
 A Java project using Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest path that implements traffic simulation on an interactive Luxembourg map. It features traffic animation and the option to add a variable number of cars. Their path can change dynamically based on the congestion levels found.

 # Memory Game
  A WPF-based memory game with functions such as user sign-up and sign-in, statistics, game saves, custom grid size, photo categories, win/fail conditions. The players, along their statistics and game saves are stored in json files. Once a player wins or starts a game, their stats update. Any player can see other player's stats, but cannot load another player's savegame. WHen a player saves their game, the previous savefile gets overwritten and the state of the game (flipped tiles, time left) is stored.
